# hello-world

Hello, my name is Daria.

I originally come from Russia, lived 7 years in France, and now I come to Canada for new opportunities and challenges. 

I have worked for various companies in various roles, but what really became my dream job was Scrum Master role. 

I've received a Master's degree in Project Management back in 2012 from Higher School of Economics, a well-known Russian business school. In 2014 I have finally obtained my Ceritificate for Professional Scrum Master from Scrum.org with an amazing result of 96%. I have then almost immediately stepped-up to a new role at PayPal as a Scrum Master for our team.

I've always been known for strong organizational skills that help me a lot in my career choice. At the same time, I stay creative and flexible. I like to work with people as part of a team and can be independent when working on specific projects.

My professional interest lies in software and web development, as well as video games. Though, I do not have purely technical education or experience, I have a good understanding of this area. I have even developed my own website from scratch when I was working on my entrepreneurial project. I'm also attending CS50 class on edX and am counting on completing it before the end of this summer.

I'm currently looking for new Scrum Master or Agile Project Manager opportunities in Toronto, Canada. Please feel free to contact me via email.

Best,
Daria Bagina
